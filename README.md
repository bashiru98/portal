## Quick start

- First, make sure to run the DB script in the top level package.
- Spin up the `Dockerfile` script in the backend package.
- Install packages with `pnpm i` and launch the app with `pnpm run start` in each of the two packages. You'll have to provide your own values in the `env` for each, for which an example is included.

A detailed contributing and architecture guide is coming soon!

- If the issue you found has been reported and is still open, and the details match your issue, give a "thumbs up" to the relevant posts in the issue thread to signal that you have the same issue. No further action is required on your part.
- If the issue you found has been reported and is still open, but the issue is missing some details, you can add a comment to the issue thread describing the additional details.
